# Virtual Environment Commands

I prefer handling virtual environments using only **pip**, **venv**. Following are some useful commands on *Windows*.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| python3 -m \<venv\> /path/to/new/virtual/environment | create a virtual environment called \<venv\> |
| \<venv\>\Scripts\activate | open \<venv\> virtual environment |
| deactivate | close the current environment |
| pip install -r requirements.txt | install packages from a txt file |
